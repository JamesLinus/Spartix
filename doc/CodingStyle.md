# Spartix Coding Guidelines
This file will describe the Coding Guidelines used to get a pull accepted to the OS
## Identation
A tab MUST equal 8 spaces ( don't come up with any broken identation, because i won't fix it )
## Operator spacing
The operators in the C source files will always be seperated by a space
Example:
	i = j + x;
## Bracket position
The brackets will always be in the same line as the if/for/while statement, except with a function
