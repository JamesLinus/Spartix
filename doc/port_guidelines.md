# Port Guidelines

## Requirements for a port to the Spartix OS
- ELF file support ( the binary must be in ELF format )
- No use of dynamic libraries ( They are not yet supported )
- No use of fancy 2D and 3D features

## Requirements for a port to be accepted in the Spartix source tree
- It MUST not be a really hacky patch
- It MUST work
- It MUST be legal ( can't contain code used without permition )
- It MAY work flawlessly ( Full support of something is hard to get with Hobby OS'es )
- It MUST not be broken software or very vulnerable software ( Software that deals with system calls directly is one example )
