# Spartix
## An x86/AMD64 Operating system

## In order to build Spartix, you need:

- An i686-elf cross compiler (Instructions can be found at __http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross_Compiler__ )
- Grub 2 installed on your machine (Doesn't matter if you boot your system using Grub 2, you just need the utilities)
- POSIX shell ( Bash is the most common, but things like Cygwin and MSYS will work too)
- Unix like environment
