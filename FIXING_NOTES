Observations:
	The ESP is correct
	I'm not sure if the memory is mapped correctly
	I think the TSS might be ruining task switching
	Needs alot of debugging
	I need to implement CR3 task switching
	There is a very serious bug in the GDT, as the entries were conforming
	Thats whats causing the triple fault, as the processor is respecting the GDT entries, so it cannot jump to higher privileged code
